      "content"     : "Rothenburg, Germany 2020This is an example blog post that I threw together as an example of what a piece of literature would look like in this site’s ever-growing encyclopedia of knowledge. I am not sure what the contents of this forum will contain yet, so I am going to let it form over time.This novella will start as some of the first technical writings that I have created for fun. I want to share any thoughts, learnings, photos, tools, or programs that I am interested in. I will continue learning various different topics, so writing these posts to explain different topics will help with the topic’s retention. I am a big fan of puzzles. I enjoy finding order in chaos. Writing will help explain complicated concepts in ways that everyone can understand. I want to improve myself by being able to better explain complicated topics to others. The more I do something, I would hope to get better at it.“Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”Ever since I first saw Steve Job’s Stanford commencement speach on YouTube, those words stuck with me. Those are words that I currently live by, not only for my preferences towards good food and comedies. I am curious by nature and will always continue to find ways to improve as a person. I picture myself learning and posting about many different topics, which could cover but are not limited to:  Tech and software  Business practices  Finances and markets  US/World Travelling  FoodIf any of that sounds interesting, keep an eye out for more posts that I will be sharing. Cheers!P.S. This post was made to be more light-hearted, comical, and slightly sarcastic. Try not read too deep into anything mentioned above."
