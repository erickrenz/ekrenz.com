# Hey, I'm Eric Krenz
<br/>
On this website you will find some more [about me](/about), what I have been working on, and tangents on topics that are interesting to me. 
<br/><br/>

I've worked at [three Fortune 100 Companies](../about/#work-experience) in the US and Europe, lived and worked in Germany for 8 months, and recieved a graduate [certificate from Harvard Business School](../about/#education). My major was Computer Engineering, and I graduated with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. In college, I was elected [Vice President of my fraternity](../about/#activities-and-involvement), skydove from 10,000 feet, travelled to more than a dozen countries, and became engaged all before my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday.
<br/><br/>

 Cheers! üçª
<br/>Eric
