&lt;p&gt;This is an example blog post that I threw together as an example of what a piece of literature would look like in this site’s ever-growing encyclopedia of knowledge. I am not sure what the contents of this forum will contain yet, so I am going to let it form over time.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This novella will start as some of the first technical writings that I have created for fun. I want to share any thoughts, learnings, photos, tools, or programs that I am interested in. I will continue learning various different topics, so writing these posts to explain different topics will help with the topic’s retention. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of puzzles. I enjoy finding order in chaos. Writing will help explain complicated concepts in ways that everyone can understand. I want to improve myself by being able to better explain complicated topics to others. The more I do something, I would hope to get better at it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-hungry-stay-foolish&quot;&gt;“Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I first saw Steve Job’s Stanford commencement speach on YouTube, those words stuck with me. Those are words that I currently live by, not only for my preferences towards good food and comedies. I am curious by nature and will always continue to find ways to improve as a person. I picture myself learning and posting about many different topics, which could cover but are not limited to:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech and software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business practices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finances and markets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;US/World Travelling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of that sounds interesting, keep an eye out for more posts that I will be sharing. Cheers!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. This post was made to be more light-hearted, comical, and slightly sarcastic.
