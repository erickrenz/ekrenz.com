&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve worked at &lt;a href=&quot;../about/#work-experience&quot;&gt;three Fortune 100 Companies&lt;/a&gt; in the US and Europe, lived and worked in Germany for 8 months, and recieved a graduate &lt;a href=&quot;../about/#education&quot;&gt;certificate from Harvard Business School&lt;/a&gt;. My major was Computer Engineering, and I graduated with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. In college, I was elected &lt;a href=&quot;../about/#activities-and-involvement&quot;&gt;Vice President of my fraternity&lt;/a&gt;, skydove from 10,000 feet, and travelled to more than a dozen countries all before my 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; birthday.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have questions or comments? I would like to hear from you! Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickrenz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;connect with me on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:krenzew@mail.uc.edu&quot;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;.
