Hello, world
August 23, 2010

This is an example blog post that I’m putting together to, well, show what a blog post would look like on this fine Web establishment. I’m not sure what it will entail just yet, so I’m going to let it write itself. Let’s begin, shall we?

Writing helps me put my thoughts together. I’m incoherent most of the time unless I take a moment to collect my thoughts and write them down. Writing is a sanity check and I welcome the challenge it presents. It’s one thing to have a thought, but it’s another to be able to craft that into something that’s understandable to others.

### Challenge
It’s really a challenge of self-improvement. If I do something enough, presumably I’ll get better at it. Coupled with feedback from others, it’s a win-win situation every time I sit down to write. That said, I don’t want to limit myself to just writing. I envision this blog as a showcase for:

Thoughts on design—UI, interaction, visual
Code snippets I feel are useful to others
My favorite photographs
Music and movie reviews
And more?
So based on that, keep a watchful eye on everything that I’ll be sharing. And try to enjoy!

P.S. This post was done in good humor. Try not to take anything I say too seriously. kthxbai
