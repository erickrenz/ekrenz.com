<p><br />
On this website you will find some more <a href="/about">about me</a>, what I have been working on, and tangents on topics that are interesting to me. 
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I‚Äôve worked at <a href="../about/#work-experience">three Fortune 100 Companies</a> in the US and Europe, lived and worked in Germany for 8 months, and recieved a graduate <a href="../about/#education">certificate from Harvard Business School</a>. My major was Computer Engineering, and I graduated with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. In college, I was elected <a href="../about/#activities-and-involvement">Vice President of my fraternity</a>, skydove from 10,000 feet, travelled to more than a dozen countries, and became engaged all before my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday.
